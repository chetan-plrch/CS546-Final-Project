 ### Introduction to Project
 
 - In todayâ€™s world, mental health issues faced are more than ever. Our website aims towards addressing these issues and giving its users the best help possible with their issues like depression, anxiety, etc.,
 - The website allows users to be completely anonymous if they wish and chat with professionals about their feelings and the issues that they are facing in order to get the help that they need.
 - Users are also shown a feed that consists of posts, pictures and quotes which are motivational and happy in nature to help them uplift their mental state. It is completely up to the users if they want to continue talking to the experts.
